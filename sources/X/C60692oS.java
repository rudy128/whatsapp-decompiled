If\nyou are not expecting to initialize EmojiCompat manually in your application,\nplease check to ensure it has not been removed from your APK's manifest. You can\ndo this in Android Studio using Build > Analyze APK.\n\nIn the APK Analyzer, ensure that the startup entry for\nEmojiCompatInitializer and InitializationProvider is present in\n AndroidManifest.xml. If it is missing or contains tools:node=\"remove\", and you\nintend to use automatic configuration, verify:\n\n  1. Your application does not include emoji2-bundled\n  2. All modules do not contain an exclusion manifest rule for\n     EmojiCompatInitializer or InitializationProvider. For more information\n     about manifest exclusions see the documentation for the androidx startup\n     library.\n\nIf you intend to use emoji2-bundled, please call EmojiCompat.init. You can\nlearn more in the documentation for BundledEmojiCompatConfig.\n\nIf you intended to perform manual configuration, it is recommended that you call\nEmojiCompat.init immediately on application startup.\n\nIf you still cannot resolve this issue, please open a bug with your specific\nconfiguration to help improve error message.");
